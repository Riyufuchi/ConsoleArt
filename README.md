## About

This project started quite some time ago, the initial commit was on 13th of July 2020. This project wasn't meant to have any "form or shape", just project for experimenting in C++, but it was turned into proper C++ project with focus on converting image to ASCII/UNICODE. So now it continues in this flow and it still serves it purpose that it is for learning/experimenting in C++.

## Donate

I'm a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ student, so a few dollars will be enough. If you are planning to use this library in a commercial application, then it would be fair if you would send more, possibly a small share of 5-10% of monthly profits.
